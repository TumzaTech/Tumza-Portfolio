# Welcome to My Portfolio

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tumi Tlatla, a young tech man passionate about building creative and functional projects using HTML & CSS.
This is my portfolio i made part of the PLP Software Development Hackatoon. I am still new to web development so, I kept my website simple
as those are the only things i know and I did not want to complicate myself with things I do not know of.
I'll be looking forward to hearing from you what you think of the website. Click the link to check out my websiteðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰https://tumzatech.github.io/PLP-TumzaPortfolio/Tumza-Portfolio
